# tourist_spots

A new Flutter project.

# flutter_tourist_spots

This project uses the Flutter Framework from Google to create 3 applications from the same code base (Android, IOS and Web). It uses Firebase as the database for the application. Soon it will get uploaded on the Android Play Store and IOS App Store and I will post the links to try the app here.
